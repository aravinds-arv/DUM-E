# DUM-E
Just a rather very dumb [hydraulic arm](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Dum-E_and_U). DUM-E can help you if you are a dev on discord!

### What can DUM-E do?

If you're a developer and use discord as your primary medium of communication, you must've realized how tiring and lethargic it feels to switch to your browser window and search for the bug üêõ that you just hit while sharing your screen to your clients/project manager. Fear not for DUM-E has arrived to give you a helping hand (or more precisely a hydraulic arm ü¶æ). DUM-E reduces manual effort and increases developer productivity (factor: 20x) in the following ways:-

- It says `pong` when you say `!ping` signalling that it's up and running

- It motivates you when you feel low about your unresolved bugs. Just ask him to `!inspire`

- It delivers all the latest tech news from dev.to at specified intervals of time.

- It picks yours query, places it on stackoverflow and returns all relevant answers directly to your server. The spell: `!sso "<YOUR QUERY>"`

### How to configure?
- Copy .env.sample to a new file .env and replace the placeholder with your bot token
- Replace the `STACK_API_KEY` placeholder with your stack app key. Create a stack app by logging into the [Stackexchange API portal](http://stackapps.com/apps/oauth/register)
- (Optional) Create and use virtual environment for the project. Steps may vary depending on your OS, check out [this link](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
- Install all the requirements
- Replace the `tech_news_channel_id` with your appropriate channel id, find it by enabling developer mode in discord settings and right clicking on the channel you want to receive the tech news in.
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Run DUM-E üéâ
```bash
$ python main.py
```

### Boilerplate code for beginners
New to discord.py? Here's a boiler snippet you can use and extend as you please..
```python
import os
import discord
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from discord.ext import commands

intents = discord.Intents.default()
intents.message_content = True
intents.members = True

load_dotenv()
TOKEN = os.getenv("TOKEN") # do configure your TOKEN in a .env file
client = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!", intents=intents)

@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f"{client.user} is logged in")

@client.command()
async def ping(ctx):
    await ctx.reply("pong")

client.run(TOKEN)
```

### A checklist of things to be done in the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers)
- Create a new application
- Add a bot in the Bot tab
- Click on reset token and copy the token (use responsibly, if exposed your bot could be misused)
- Click on `OAuth`>`URL Generator` and check the option `bot` under `scopes`
- Give your required permissions


- Copy the generated URL and paste in a new browser tab
- Invite your bot to any of your servers
